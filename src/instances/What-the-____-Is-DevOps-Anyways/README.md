## A Presentation on DevOps, and Why You Should Care

Repository for my 2020 presentation to the SELU<sup>[1](#footnote-1)</sup> ACM<sup>[2](#footnote-2)</sup> Chapter entitled "What the #@&% is DevOps, Anyways?: A Presentation on DevOps, and Why You Should Care." All the slides are PowerShell scripts that generate a loop-based slideshow. Like my previous presentation, I've used a collection of "helper" scripts that may eventually become a PowerShell module for creating a presentation inside of a PowerShell!

## Presentation Configurations:

In order to run these scripts it is recommended to set the following in Windows/PowerShell Core:

- Windows Display Settings:
    - Resolution: 1920x1080
    - Scaling: 100%
- PowerShell Core Display Settings:
    - Font Size: 12
    - Font: LiterationMono NF
