## Scripting Away the Problems of Yesterday

Repository for my SQL Saturday 2019 Presentation "Azure Automation with PowerShell: Scripting Away the Problems of Yesterday. All the slides in the PowerPoint are screenshots of PowerShell screens generated from scripts in this repository. I've noticed patterns in individual scripts and started to collect logic into "helpers" that may eventually become a PowerShell module for creating a presentation inside of a PowerShell console! In order to run these scripts it is recommended to set the following in Windows/PowerShell:

- Windows Display Settings:
    - Resolution: 1920x1080
    - Scaling: 175%
- PowerShell Display Settings:
    - Font Size: 16
    - Font: LiterationMono NF
