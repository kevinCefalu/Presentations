# Don't Skip ARM Day: Your Bicep Will Thank You

>A Presentation on [Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates]((https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates), [Azure Bicep templates and modules](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/), and why you should care.

Source for my [2023 PowerShell + DevOps Global Summit](https://powershellsummit.org/) Lightning Talk entitled "Don't Skip ARM Day: Your Bicep Will Thank You." All the slides are generate in a C#.NET console app. Unlike my previous presentations, I've created a presentation engine that uses [Spectre Console](https://spectreconsole.net/) and [YAML configuration](./configuration.yaml) to generate the slides.

The demos can be found [here](./demos).
